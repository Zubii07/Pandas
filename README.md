# Pandas Basics Learning

## Introduction

This repository showcases my learning journey with **pandas**, a powerful Python library for data manipulation and analysis. I have focused on understanding the basics of pandas and applied my knowledge to solve a variety of problems. 
My primary resources for learning were **Geeks for Geeks** and **W3Schools**, which provided great tutorials and examples to deepen my understanding of pandas.

## Problems Solved

Here are the problems I solved to practice and strengthen my pandas skills:

### 1. Create a DataFrame from a Dictionary
- Created DataFrame from a dictionary containing `Product`, `Price`, and `Stock`.

### 2. Filtering Data Based on Conditions
- Filtered rows based on conditions like `Age < 25` and `Country == 'Canada'`.

### 3. Simple Arithmetic Operations
- Added new columns based on arithmetic operations such as calculating `Profit` (difference between `Sales` and `Expenses`).
  
### 4. Adding and Removing Columns
- Added new columns and removed existing columns from DataFrames to manipulate the data as needed.

### 5. Find the Maximum and Minimum
- Found the product with the highest and lowest price from a list of products.

### 6. Sort Data
- Sorted the DataFrame based on `Score` and `Name` in ascending/descending order.

### 7. Renaming Columns
- Renamed DataFrame columns to more meaningful names using the `rename` function.

### 8. Working with Date Columns
- Converted a date column to the datetime format and extracted `Year` and `Month`.

### 9. DataFrame Concatenation
- Concatenated two DataFrames together to merge data efficiently.

### 10. Value Counts
- Used `value_counts()` to count occurrences of unique values in a column.

### 11. **Data Cleaning**
- Handled missing values using imputation methods (mean, median) and dropped rows/columns where necessary.

### 12. **Sorting Data**
- Mastered the art of sorting datasets by multiple columns in both ascending and descending order.

### 13. **Groupby Operation**
- Grouped data by a specific column and calculated the mean, sum, or other aggregation functions on numerical columns.

### 14. **Simple Data Analysis**
- Performed basic exploratory data analysis on datasets with a focus on numerical and categorical columns.

### 15. **Working with Categorical Data**
- Used pandas for analyzing categorical data and converting it into a usable format for further analysis.

### 16. **Merging and Joining DataFrames**
- Combined datasets using different types of joins (inner, left, right, outer).

### 17. **Handling Time Series Data**
- Worked with time series data and applied techniques like resampling, rolling windows, and date-based indexing.

### 18. **Advanced Data Manipulation**
- Performed advanced data manipulations such as pivot tables, reshaping data, and more.


## ðŸ”§ Tools and Libraries Used

This repository was created using the following tools and libraries:

- **[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)**: The core library for data manipulation and analysis in Python.
- **[Python](https://www.python.org/)**: The programming language used for solving the problems.
- **[Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)**: Used for running code interactively and documenting the learning process.

## Future Revisions

As I continue learning and working with pandas, I will revise these problems and continue adding more complex problems to the repository. This will help me strengthen my skills and expand my knowledge of pandas for more advanced data analysis tasks.

## Resources

- **[Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/)** - A comprehensive tutorial site with clear explanations and examples for data manipulation in pandas.
- **[W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/pandas/default.asp)** - Another excellent resource for understanding pandas and its functionality.
